/**
 * EPP is a session-oriented service - all commands (except session management)
 * are only accepted by an EPP server if within a session context.  The Session
 * interface provides the necessary operations to negotiate and use an EPP
 * session; open, close, read and write being the primary operations.
 * The state of a session is maintained internally; state conditions considered
 * relevant to users of a session are visible through the isOpen, isInvalid and
 * isAvailable methods.  The acquire and release methods can be used to
 * synchronise use of a Session if the implementation requires this.  EPP
 * allows for servers to close idle connections after a server policy defined
 * period.  In order to keep a session open in this situation, it is necessary
 * to poll the server with valid EPP commands at regular intervals; the
 * keepAlive method provides this functionality.  Upon successfully negotiating
 * a connection to a server, an EPP greeting service element is sent to the
 * client; a representation of that greeting is available using getGreeting.  A
 * session must publish operational data to a StatsManager which is sufficient
 * for the StatsManager to meet its interface obligations.  That StatsManager
 * is made available via getStatsManager.
